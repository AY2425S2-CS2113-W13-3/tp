# Loh Jay Hon, Giggs - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
Our team developed a personal finance tracker application that helps users manage their income and expenses through a command-line interface. The application allows users to track financial transactions, generate reports, and export data for further analysis.

### Enhancements Implemented

1. **Budget Feature Implementation (`setbudget` Command)**
    * Implemented full support for setting monthly budgets by month/year and amount.
    * Created `SetBudgetCommand` to execute logic, handled validation for months, years, and positive values.
    * Extended the parser and `Ui` to prompt and validate user inputs for budget setting.
    * Updated `TransactionManager` and `Storage` to store and retrieve budget information persistently.

2. **Enhanced Transaction Listing (`list` Command)**
    * Enabled support for optional `limit` and/or `start date` in `ListCommand`.
    * Implemented logic to filter transactions from a date or limit their count.
    * Added robust parsing and validation in the parser, including `readStartDate()` and `readLimit()` methods.
    * Designed friendly CLI interactions and informative logger messages to guide the user.

3. **Range-Based Transaction Deletion (`delete` Command)**
    * Designed and implemented support for both single index and index range deletion (e.g., `2` or `2-5`).
    * Created `readIndexRange()` in `Ui.java` to process and validate inputs.
    * Implemented reverse-index deletion in `TransactionManager` to avoid index shifting issues.
    * Ensured appropriate error handling for invalid, zero, or negative indexes.

4. **Budget Persistence System**
    * Developed the logic in `Storage.java` to save and load monthly budgets from `budgets.txt`.
    * Used a simple `yyyy-MM|amount` format for easy readability and debugging.
    * Ensured fault-tolerant file parsing with proper error logging.

5. **Parser Enhancements**
    * Extended the parser to support multiple new commands (`list`, `delete`, `setbudget`).
    * Added full validation for number formats, ranges, empty inputs, and incorrect date formats.
    * Refactored and modularized the parser methods (`parseDeleteCommand`, `parseListCommand`, `parseSetBudgetCommand`, etc.) for testability and clarity.
    * Logged parsing operations in detail for easier debugging.

### Contributions to Team-Based Tasks

* Maintained and organized `Parser.java`, ensuring all new commands were properly integrated.
* Coordinated common logger usage and parser error handling strategies across the team.
* Contributed to test script setup and CI enhancements (e.g., `runtest.sh`, `runtest.bat` compatibility).
* Reviewed teammates’ parser and command PRs for consistency with project style and standards.

---

### Review/Mentoring Contributions

* Reviewed over 10 PRs with thorough suggestions, especially those related to parser structure, storage handling, and UI prompts.
* Helped teammates debug logging configuration issues and Windows file lock problems.
* Example review:
    * [PR #101 - Quick Updates](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/101)

### Contributions Beyond the Project Team

* Investigated and helped resolve a Windows-specific file lock issue caused by Java’s `FileHandler`.
* Shared tips on how to resolve text-ui-test issues since data was not being appropriately cleared.

### List Command

Lists transactions filtered optionally by a start date and/or a limit.

Format: `list`

The app will prompt for:

Example Interaction:
```
> list  
Please enter the start date in the format yyyy-mm-dd:
