## Overview

Our team developed FinBro, a personal finance tracker application designed for command-line interaction. It allows users to manage their income and expenses, search and filter transactions, and gain financial insights with minimal friction.

I focused on improving the user experience and robustness of FinBro by introducing interactive CLI prompts, defensive input handling, and transaction validation features.

### Enhancements Implemented

1. **Interactive CLI Input Mode**
   * Enabled guided input mode for `income`, `expense`, and `search` commands
   * Implemented step-by-step prompting through `Parser.java` and `Ui.java` to improve user experience for new users


2. **Defensive Input Validation**
   * Created custom exceptions: `EmptyInputException`, `NegativeNumberException`, `DecimalPointException`
   * Enhanced `Ui.java` with robust `readDouble`, `readIndex`, and `readString` methods that validate and retry on bad input 
   * Prevented crashes from malformed or missing inputs with retry loops and informative error messaging


3. **Duplicate Transaction Detection**
   * Implemented duplicate detection for transactions based on amount and description in `TransactionManager`
   * Added confirmation prompt (`warnDuplicate`) in `Ui.java` to allow user decision on proceeding with duplicates


4. **Indexed Category Selection**
   * Built an index-based selection system for expense categories in `parseCategory(Ui ui)`
   * Improves discoverability and consistency of category assignment


5. **Search Feature**
   * Developed `SearchCommand` for keyword-based transaction lookup
   * Supports interactive prompt and case-insensitive matching in descriptions

### 1. Recording Income

Records money received into your account.

**Format:** `income`, `AMOUNT`, `DESCRIPTION`. `[TAGS]`

**Parameters:**
* `AMOUNT`: A positive number with up to 2 decimal places

**Enhanced Duplicate Detection**

FinBro automatically checks for **duplicate transactions** based on the same amount and description.
